# rstudio_addins_on_cran

1. This app takes benefit from the unofficial [CRAN mirror on github](https://github.com/cran) and completes searching through [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/). 

2. Currently, many RStudio addins only live in the wild on Github. [Dean Attali](https://github.com/daattali) solved this problem by creating a [project](https://github.com/daattali/rstudio-addins) listing out all those packages. If you are actively looking for an addin, I think that project is more realistically useful. 

3. There seems to be a bug on Github API that sometimes the API search may miss one or two items. When this bug happened, it took place at the initial data fetch step. There seems to be nothing I can do...
